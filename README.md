# Medical Management System App

The Medical Management System App project aims to transform and modernize our medical system by providing a digital platform for managing patient data, medical histories, and medication distribution. This initiative is a response to the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need for efficient and accessible healthcare solutions.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in our medical system, prompting us to rethink and innovate. This project seeks to create an app that streamlines medical processes, securely stores patient data, and ensures efficient medicine distribution. The app caters to three main user roles: Doctors, Patients, and Pharmacy Sellers.

## User Roles and Features

### Doctors
- **Access Patient Data**: Doctors can access patient data, allowing them to view medical histories and add new medical information.
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Ensures that only authorized medical professionals can access patient information.
- **Privacy**: Patient data is protected, and doctors can only see the data relevant to their patients.

### Patients
- **View Medical Histories**: Patients can access their entire medical history, empowering them to make informed healthcare decisions.
- **Access Current Medications**: Patients can view their current medications, ensuring they stay on top of their treatment.
- **Privacy**: Patient data is confidential, and patients have full control over their information.

### Pharmacy Sellers
- **Access Current Medications**: Pharmacy sellers can view patients' current medications to facilitate medicine distribution.
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Ensures that pharmacy sellers can only access relevant patient information.
- **Privacy**: Patient data, including medical histories, is protected.

## Data Management

- **Structured Data**: For structured data such as doctor profiles, IDs, and passwords, we use SQLite3 in our Python project.
- **Non-Structured Data**: Patient medical histories and related data are stored in JSON files. This approach ensures that users can access their data offline when using the app.
